# Wetzel Remote Connect (WRC)
### Introduction:
How are you doing today?

Good?

Good.

O.K., to the point: I have nothing here (yet). My plans will be put below. Keep up to date with my project to see the 
development of it and stuff.

### Plans:
- Plan out project
- Structure github
- Rewrite this markdown file

### To-do:
- Create Commands ABC class; CreepAPI and SSH classes (api's? something, idk) to fill in the HOW those commands will
be ran

### To-do Later:
- Research ways to make more secure (crypto!)
- Rewrite entire "KeyHandler" Script to something a little more... clean? Verbose? idk, something more than it is now
- Restructure github to follow format listed [here](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/?)
- GUI to make life easier; starting with a basic command line working up to designed ui
### The Concept:
WRC is a small plan to make a remote connection client for (specifically) Minecraft servers. It should allow for passing
commands to the server to control in-game content. Some extra features (off the top of my head) could be a ftp client/ssh
 client to allow remote connection to the server running the Minecraft server.
