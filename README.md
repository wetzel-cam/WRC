# Wetzel Remote Connect (WRC)
### Introduction:
How are you doing today?

Good?

Good.

O.K., to the point: I have nothing here (yet). My plans will be put below. Keep up to date with my project to see the development of it and stuff.

### Plans:
- Plan out project
- Structure github
- Rewrite this markdown file

### The Concept:
WRC is a small plan to make a remote connection client for (specifically) Minecraft servers. It should allow for passing commands to the server to control in-game content. Some extra features (off the top of my head) could be a ftp client/ssh client to allow remote connection to the server running the Minecraft server.
